D1 = binning, dummies, soil & wild dummies
D2 = binning but no dummies, soil & wild dummies
D3 = binning, soil& wild made into 1 col, WOE
D4 = binning, mean encoding
D5 = binning



Multiclass
1* H0: Binning makes things better, without dummy creation
2* H0: PCA makes things better



One vs All
* H0: Binning makes things better: D1 vs D3
* H0: Scaling makes things better: D3 vs D4
* H0: Adding PCA makes things better: D3/D4 vs (D3/D4)+preProcWrapper




One vs One
* H0: WOE makes things better
