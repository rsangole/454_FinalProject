# Introduction

# The Modeling Problem
There is a need to predict the forest cover for 30 x 30 meter cells using cartographic variables obtained from US Forest Service (USFS) Region 2 Resource Information System (RIS) data.  The objective is to predict cover type as a multiclass classification problem based on the associated attributes (features). 

# The Data: Data Inventory and Data Quality Check

# EDA: Initial exploratory data analysis.

# Predictive Modeling: Methods and Results:  Initial modeling results.

# Next Steps: List of statistical techniques that you will pursue.
